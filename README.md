# ryze-tello-matlab-control
Matlab scrip for controlling ryze Tello drone

Started this project because 
* the matlab support package for the Ryze Tello Drone keeps crashing usually in the event when the WIFI is switched off. 
* the matlab support package does not offer so much control such as the native roll, throttle, pitch and yaw control commands.
